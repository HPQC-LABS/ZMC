\begin_layout Abstract
We list all possible point groups for 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,3,4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 atoms as well as for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-atom molecules with specified formulas.
 For each point group, we give examples of molecules of each size and formula
 if they are known, and hence we determine the yet-to-be discovered molecules
 with under 5 atoms for each point group.
 We establish a small set of principles that can be used for proofs about
 the possibility or impossibility for a molecule of a certain size and/or
 formula to have a point group symmetry.

Our need for answers to the question in the present paper's title, arose

 But the geometries were wrong and we need to be able to generate them from
 places like the Landolt-Bornstein volumes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Such volumes provide only the point group, a 3D diagram, and a minimal
 set of bond lengths, angles and dihedrals.
 For example H
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

Si
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 (not in GW100 but good for illustrating this point) gives only two bond
 lengths and a dihedral, but to do electronic structure calculations we
 need either the XYZ coordinates of all atoms, or a z-matrix for the molecule,
 and there is no softawre for obtaining either of these from just the limited
 information given.
 A software for generating a z-matrix from this data would be significantly
 simpler to write than a software for generating XYZ coordinates of all
 atoms, but the z-matrix for this system would need at least one bond angle,
 and you might find it surprising that the simplest formulas for the HHSi?
 angle in H
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

Si
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 is...
 Determining this bond angle can be accomplished with some high school level
 trigonometry (applications of the ordinary cosin law), and appliocations
 of the 
\emph on

 which is unlikely to be taught in high school or university-level curricula,
 and can be learned and applied to such small molecules within a day by
 most researchers, but with the pace of research today, the derivation of
 such a formulas as in Eqs.
 () would ideally be done by softawre rather than by hand.

Furthermore, the interest today in machine learning and big data analysis
 has lead to the introduction of much larger datasets such as GW5000, OE31?
 and OE62 (all from [Rinke]) which involve 5000, 31000 and 61000 molecules
 respectively, but they have the same geometry problem (crystal structures
 vs spectroscopic geometries).
 This reinforces our motivation for constructing a software that could,
 for example, convert the ~5000 geometries from Landolt-Bornstein into z-matrice
s or XYZ coordinates.
 We believe that as machine learning and big data analysis become more popular
 over the next century, there will be a rise in interest in being able to
 categorieze molecules (e.g.
 for training neural networks) and the question of which point groups are
 possibel for molecules of a certain size of formula, will be asked more
 and more (and those seeking the answers will be able to find them in this
 paper).

A software to generate z-matrices (or even XYZ coordinates) for molecules
 with the data presented in experimental papers, such as (r1=,r2=,phi=)
 for H2Si2 would require specific code blocks for each molecular shape.
 
\series default
It is possible for two molecules with the same point group to have very
 different shapes (e.g.
 C2v for H2Si2 and C2v planar and maybe another 4-atom C2v, all have 4 atoms
 but one is pyramidal, one is planar, etc.), so a

 or

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would need specific code blocks for n-atom molecules not just based on
 their point group, but also based on other characteristics (perhaps their
 graph, formula, etc.), but a natural first step towards constructing such
 a software would be to categorize n-atom molecules based on their point
 groups (as done in the Landolt Bornstein series and a lot of other places,
 check CRC), and to construct code for each case.
 
\series bold
For n atoms, how many cases do we need to consider in order to cover each
 point group at least once in the software?
\series default
 That is the essence of the question in the present paper's title, and everyone
 tell us that it hasn't been done yet.
 We take this even one step further, by looking at the possible formulas,
 for example for a 7-atom molecule to have the point group Ci you need its
 formula to be A2B2C2D (with any of B,C,D being allowed to be a duplicate
 of one of the previous letters) but a molecule with any other formula cannot
 have the point group Ci (for example A2B3C2 would no work unless B and
 C are A, which would bring us back to the previously mentioned formula
 in the case in which A=B=C=D).

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
In the initial stages of the development of our z-matrix constructor, we
 found that the Landolt-Bornstein series had all these molecules, but we
 realized that we missed the tadpole structure because we know that there's
 6 connected 4-vertex graphs.
 Likewise we tried to see if we had representation from all possible point
 groups, and this required us to first determine the possible point groups
 for 4-atom molecules (which surprisingly we couldn't find, and we found
 that experts who wrote books on the topics were also unaware).
 In doing this, we discovered that D2 and D2d are possible but not yet found,
 so this may be an avenue for further experimental research.

Another motivation was geometry optimization.
 Roland Lindh and others have discovered that you can get fewer cycles,
 but if point group symemtry is included, then we can have a smaller Wilson-B
 matrix.

In this paper we provide general principles, 3-atom and 4-atom possible
 groups, formulas and examples, n-atom groups and formulas for minimal structure

 We skip the polyhedral groups

 As more letters in the formula become the same, it becomes less likely

 it is still possible to construct an object with 4 identical points (or

 Since the

If we have three or fewer atoms, then there does not even need to be an

If we have four atoms, and

we make the inversion center the origin, the atoms must come in pairs according

If we have five atoms, the fifth one must be at the origin, because atoms
 need to either be paired or at the origin in order for the inversion operation
 to be valid on the system of atoms.
 However, the other four atoms form a plane that contains the origin (because
 the plane is formed by two lines that intersect at the origin).
 Therefore the fifth atom will also be on the same plane as the other four
 atoms, and the point group will be promoted beyond

\begin_layout Standard
Pyramid formed from regualr n-gon is Dnh, we need to add at least one atom
 to break all mirror planes.
 To preserve the Cn axis we need to either add any number of atoms on the
 Cn axis, or at least n atoms that are not on the Cn axis (forming a regular
 n-gon with the Cn axis in the centre of it).
 However, adding any atoms on the axis will not break the vertical mirror
 planes, so we must add at least n more atoms and form a second concentric
 regular n-gon around the Cn axis, but it cannot be on the same plane as
 the original n-gon because then it would still have the horizontal mirror
 plane and the point group would be promoted at least to 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{nh}$
\end_inset

, and the new n-gon would have to be rotated from the original one in order
 to avoid Dnh in the case where the side-lengths are the same (horizontal
 mirror plane is just halfway between the planes of the two n-gons), and
 Cnv where the two regular n-gons have their own distinct side-lengths.

As in the case of Cn, any structure with fewer than 2n atoms will not have
 enough atoms to break the vertical planes of a Dnh n-gon, and without maintaini
ng the Cn axis.
 Having two concentric n-gons on the same plane, with one of them rotated
 from the other in order to avoid having D(2n)h, would be one way to construct
 a Cnh molecule with the minimum number of atoms.
 Another way would be to add the extra n atoms to the plane containing the
 original regular n-gon, and no rotation would be necessary if we are careful
 about how we place the bonds.

Since S2n is a generator of the S2n point group (or is it Sn) then Cn is
 in the point group because Cn = Sn^2.
 This means we need a regular polygon, but that wouldn't satisfy the S2n
 operaton unless all atoms were to be at the origin.
 You need 2n to have an S2n axis, but then you'd get Dnh, so you need another
 2n to break the Dnh.
