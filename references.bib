abstract = {Uniform polyhedra have regular faces meeting in the same manner at every vertex. Besides the five Platonic solids, the thirteen Archimedean solids, the four regular star-polyhedra of Kepler (1619) and Poinsot (1810), and the infinite families of prisms and antiprisms, there are at least fifty-three others, forty-one of which were discovered by Badoureau (1881) and Pitsch (1881). The remaining twelve were discovered by two of the present authors (H.S.M.C. and J.C.P.M.) between 1930 and 1932, but publication was postponed in the hope of obtaining a proof that there are no more. Independently, between 1942 and 1944, the third author (M.S.L.-H.) in collaboration with H. C. Longuet-Higgins, rediscovered eleven of the twelve. We now believe that further delay is pointless; we have temporarily abandoned our hope of obtaining a proof that our enumeration is complete, but we shall be much surprised if any new uniform polyhedron is found in the future. We have classified the known figures with the aid of a systematic notation and we publish drawings (by J.C.P.M.) and photographs of models (by M .S.L.-H.) which include all those not previously constructed. One remarkable new polyhedron is contained in the present list, having eight edges at a vertex. This is the only one which cannot be derived immediately from a spherical triangle by Wythoff's construction.},

    abstract = "{The increasingly popular GW method is becoming a convenient tool to determine vertical ionization energies in molecular systems. However, depending on the formalism used and the range of orbitals investigated, it may be hampered by a steep computational scaling. To alleviate this issue, correlated natural virtual orbitals (NVOs) based on second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) and direct MP2 correlation energies are implemented, and the resulting correlated NVOs are tested on GW quasiparticle energies. Test cases include the popular GW variants G0W0 and evGW0 as well as more elaborate vertex corrections. We find that for increasingly larger molecular systems and basis sets, NVOs considerably improve efficiency. Furthermore, we test the performance of the truncated (frozen) NVO ansatz on the GW100 test set. For the latter, it is demonstrated that, using a carefully chosen truncation threshold, NVOs lead to a negligible loss in accuracy while providing speedups of one order of magnitude. Furthermore, we compare the resulting quasiparticle energies to very accurate vertical ionization energies obtained from coupled-cluster theory with singles, doubles, and noniterative triples [CCSD(T)], confirming that the loss in accuracy introduced by truncating the NVOs is negligible compared to the methodical errors in the GW approximation. It is also demonstrated that the choice of basis set impacts results far more than using a suitably truncated NVO space. Therefore, at the same computational expense, more accurate results can be obtained using NVOs. Finally, we provide improved reference CCSD(T) values for the GW100 test set, which have been obtained using the def2-QZVPP basis set.}",

abstract = {This handbook presents structural data on free polyatomic molecules. Since the structure of molecules defines the chemical, physical and biological properties of matter, this information is crucial for understanding, explaining and predicting chemical reactions and biochemical processes, developing new drugs and materials as well as studying interstellar media. Covering the structural data published between 2009 and 2017, this book supplements the previous Landolt-Börnstein volumes "Structure Data of Free Polyatomic Molecules" (eds. K. Kuchitsu, N. Vogt, M. Tanimoto), which included data from the literature published up to 2008. It systematizes and describes peculiarities of molecular structures for about 1000 compounds studied mainly by gas-phase electron diffraction and rotational spectroscopy. All structures are given in three-dimensional representations},

    abstract = { We present the GW100 set. GW100 is a benchmark set of the ionization potentials and electron affinities of 100 molecules computed with the GW method using three independent GW codes and different GW methodologies. The quasi-particle energies of the highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) are calculated for the GW100 set at the G0W0@PBE level using the software packages TURBOMOLE, FHI-aims, and BerkeleyGW. The use of these three codes allows for a quantitative comparison of the type of basis set (plane wave or local orbital) and handling of unoccupied states, the treatment of core and valence electrons (all electron or pseudopotentials), the treatment of the frequency dependence of the self-energy (full frequency or more approximate plasmon-pole models), and the algorithm for solving the quasi-particle equation. Primary results include reference values for future benchmarks, best practices for convergence within a particular approach, and average error bars for the most common approximations. }

Currently, publicly available molecular datasets with realistic molecular geometries and spectral properties are rare. We here supply a diverse benchmark spectroscopy dataset of 61,489 molecules extracted from organic crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), denoted OE62. Molecular equilibrium geometries are reported at the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) level of density functional theory (DFT) including van der Waals corrections for all 62 k molecules. For these geometries, OE62 supplies total energies and orbital eigenvalues at the PBE and the PBE hybrid (PBE0) functional level of DFT for all 62 k molecules in vacuum as well as at the PBE0 level for a subset of 30,876 molecules in (implicit) water. For 5,239 molecules in vacuum, the dataset provides quasiparticle energies computed with many-body perturbation theory in the G0W0 approximation with a PBE0 starting point (denoted GW5000 in analogy to the GW100 benchmark set (M. van Setten et al.

  abstract = "{Various isotopomers of the free dibridged disilyne molecule, Si(H2)Si, have been observed by millimeter‐ and submillimeter‐wave spectroscopy in a silane–argon plasma produced by an abnormal electric discharge. In order to make measurement of the weak absorption lines possible a novel computer processing treatment has been developed. From the molecular constants measured for 28Si(H2)28Si, 29Si(H2)28Si, 30Si(H2)28Si, and 28Si(D2)28Si an accurate substitution structure has been deduced with rs(Si–Si)=2.2154 Å, rs(Si–H)=1.6680 Å, and ∠(HSiSiH)=104.22°. The spectrum analysis and the structure determination have been aided by correlated level ab initio calculations resulting in accurate estimates of the equilibrium geometry and rotational constants, the cubic force field, the quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion constants, and the inversion barrier height of dibridged disilyne. The barrier to inversion of the ‘‘butterfly‐type’’ Si(H2)Si molecule must be relatively high as no splitting due to inversion could be experimentally observed.}",

  This chapter describes the work of Pierre Curie on symmetry. Pierre Curie is well known to the wide scientific community as an author of outstanding works on radioactivity but almost unknown as an author of deep investigations on symmetry and its applications in physics. Pierre Curie was the first to single out the symmetry groups, which is currently called the limiting point groups especially important in physics. Altogether, there are seven such groups. They can readily be remembered if one wishes to consider the simplest figures possessing such symmetry. Using the limiting symmetry groups, Pierre Curie has established for the first time one of the most important features, distinguishing an electric field from a magnetic one, and thus managed to explain why, contrary to the case of positive and negative charges, north magnetism cannot be distinguished from south magnetism. Physicists before Pierre Curie were interested mainly in the similarity rather than in differences between the magnetic and electric fields. This standpoint was supported even by mathematicians. Pierre Curie was really ahead of his contemporaries when he discovered an essential difference between the symmetries of magnetic and electric fields overlooked by the others.}
